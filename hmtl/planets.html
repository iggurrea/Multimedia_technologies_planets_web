        <h2>Mercury</h2>
        <p class="planet-text short">
          Mercury, the smallest planet in our solar system and the closest to the Sun, is only slightly larger than
          Earth's Moon. From its surface, the Sun appears over three times larger than it does from Earth, and the
          sunlight is up to seven times brighter. Temperatures on Mercury vary drastically, reaching 800°F (430°C)
          during the day and plummeting to -290°F (-180°C) at night due to the absence of an atmosphere to retain heat.

          Despite its proximity to the Sun, Mercury is not the hottest planet in the solar system, a title claimed by
          Venus due to its dense atmosphere. However, Mercury is the fastest planet, completing an orbit around the Sun
          every 88 Earth days, traveling at a speed of nearly 29 miles (47 kilometers) per second.

          Named after the swift Roman god, Mercury’s environment is not suitable for life as we know it, due to extreme
          temperatures and solar radiation. With a radius of 1,516 miles (2,440 kilometers), Mercury is just over
          one-third the size of Earth. If Earth were the size of a nickel, Mercury would be roughly the size of a
          blueberry. Positioned at an average distance of 36 million miles (58 million kilometers) from the Sun, it is
          0.4 astronomical units away, with sunlight taking 3.2 minutes to reach it.

          Mercury's orbit is highly elliptical, ranging from 29 million miles (47 million kilometers) to 43 million
          miles (70 million kilometers) from the Sun. It spins slowly on its axis, completing one rotation every 59
          Earth days. Unlike most planets, Mercury’s rotations are not accompanied by sunrise and sunset in a typical
          manner. Some parts of the planet see the Sun rise briefly, set, and rise again. A full day on Mercury (one
          complete day-night cycle) lasts 176 Earth days, equivalent to just over two years on the planet. Its axis is
          tilted by only 2 degrees, meaning it does not experience seasons.

          Mercury has no moons or rings and formed about 4.5 billion years ago when gas and dust coalesced under
          gravity. It has a dense core, composed largely of metal, with evidence of partial melting, and a thin crust
          and mantle. The planet’s surface is heavily cratered, resembling Earth’s Moon, with impacts from asteroids and
          comets throughout its history. Some impact basins, like Caloris (960 miles or 1,550 kilometers in diameter),
          were formed by asteroid collisions. The surface is mostly greyish-brown, with bright streaks known as "crater
          rays" formed by meteoroid impacts.

          Mercury's extreme temperature fluctuations are exacerbated by its lack of atmosphere. However, water ice may
          exist in permanently shadowed craters at the poles. The planet’s thin exosphere, instead of a true atmosphere,
          consists of atoms blown off the surface by solar wind and meteoroid strikes. This exosphere is primarily made
          up of oxygen, sodium, hydrogen, helium, and potassium.

          Mercury's magnetic field is weak, about 1% of Earth's, but it still interacts with the solar wind, sometimes
          creating intense magnetic tornadoes that funnel hot plasma down to the surface. When these ions strike the
          planet, they knock off atoms, sending them looping into the sky.

  <!-- Venus -->

      <div class="planet-info card-black">
        <h2>Venus</h2>
        <p class="planet-text short">
          Venus, the second planet from the Sun, is Earth's closest planetary neighbor and the hottest planet in our
          solar system. Sometimes called Earth's twin, Venus shares similar size and structure with our planet, though
          its harsh environment makes it vastly different. The thick atmosphere of Venus traps heat through a runaway
          greenhouse effect, making surface temperatures high enough to melt lead. Beneath its dense clouds, Venus has
          volcanoes and deformed mountains.

          Named after the ancient Roman goddess of love and beauty, Venus is the only planet in the solar system named
          after a female deity. Its atmosphere is primarily composed of carbon dioxide, with clouds of sulfuric acid,
          contributing to the extreme heat and pressure. Despite its inhospitable surface, scientists have speculated
          that certain regions of Venus, about 30 miles above its surface, could potentially host microbial life, given
          the right conditions. Some researchers have even suggested that microbial life might be the cause of
          mysterious streaks in Venus' clouds that absorb ultraviolet radiation.

          Venus orbits the Sun at a distance of about 67 million miles (108 million kilometers), taking 225 Earth days
          to complete one orbit. It is similar in size to Earth, with a diameter of approximately 7,521 miles (12,104
          kilometers). From Earth, Venus appears as the brightest object in the night sky after the Moon. Its phases,
          like those of the Moon, were first observed by Galileo, providing key evidence for the heliocentric model of
          the solar system.

          Venus’ day is longer than its year, taking 243 Earth days to complete one rotation. Interestingly, it rotates
          in the opposite direction to most other planets, meaning the Sun rises in the west and sets in the east. Venus
          also has no seasons, as its axial tilt is only 3 degrees, unlike Earth’s 23-degree tilt.

          Venus is one of only two planets in the solar system without moons. However, it does have a quasi-satellite,
          Zoozve, which orbits the Sun while staying near Venus. Discovered in 2002, Zoozve is the first identified
          quasi-satellite of a major planet. It is thought to have been a companion to Venus for thousands of years.

          The surface of Venus is a harsh, rocky landscape marked by volcanoes, mountains, and valleys, with some
          volcanic features named after women. Notably, Venus has the fewest impact craters of any rocky planet. Some
          surface features, such as "pancake" domes and "tick" domes, were likely formed by volcanic activity. The
          planet’s atmosphere, while mainly composed of carbon dioxide, is also home to extreme temperatures and
          pressures, with sulfuric acid clouds creating a highly corrosive environment at the surface.

          Venus lacks a magnetic field like Earth’s, instead generating a weak, induced magnetic field. This magnetic
          field is created by the interaction of the Sun's magnetic field with the electrically charged particles in
          Venus’ ionosphere. The solar wind pushes this magnetic field into a teardrop shape, surrounding the planet.

          Venus offers a compelling case for studying planetary formation and habitability. Despite its extreme
          conditions, its similarities to Earth make it an important subject for astrobiologists, who are eager to
          investigate its mysterious atmosphere and history. Understanding Venus may help us better comprehend the
          formation of rocky planets and the potential for life elsewhere in the universe.

        <h2>Earth</h2>
        <p class="planet-text short">
          Earth is the fifth largest planet in the solar system, slightly larger than Venus, and is the largest of the
          four terrestrial planets made of rock and metal closest to the Sun. Despite its size, Earth is unique because
          it is the only planet in the solar system with liquid water on its surface, making it hospitable to life.
          Unlike the other planets, Earth's name does not derive from Greek or Roman mythology but comes from Old
          English and Germanic roots, meaning simply "the ground." This name is over a thousand years old.

          Earth's ability to support life is due to its favorable temperature and chemical makeup. Most of the planet is
          covered in liquid water, which has existed for billions of years, providing a suitable environment for life to
          flourish. However, the ongoing impacts of climate change are beginning to alter these features. Earth is also
          the largest of the terrestrial planets, with an equatorial diameter of 12,760 kilometers (7,926 miles).
          Located an average of 93 million miles (150 million kilometers) from the Sun, Earth is exactly one
          astronomical unit away from it, providing a standard measure for comparing planetary distances.

          Earth completes a rotation every 23.9 hours, and it takes 365.25 days to orbit the Sun, causing the addition
          of a leap day every four years to keep our calendar in sync. The tilt of Earth's axis by 23.4 degrees leads to
          the planet's seasonal changes, with varying degrees of solar heating between the northern and southern
          hemispheres. The Moon, Earth's only natural satellite, plays a critical role in stabilizing the planet's axial
          tilt and providing a more stable climate.

          The Moon itself is believed to have formed from a collision between Earth and a massive object billions of
          years ago. Earth's Moon, the fifth-largest in the solar system, is located about 384,400 kilometers (238,855
          miles) away. Interestingly, Earth sometimes temporarily hosts small asteroids that orbit the planet before
          returning to their orbit around the Sun.

          Unlike other planets, Earth has no rings. It was formed about 4.5 billion years ago when gas and dust clumped
          together to form the planet. Earth's structure consists of four main layers: an iron-nickel core, an outer
          core, a mantle, and a crust. The inner core, which is solid, is surrounded by a molten outer core, while the
          mantle is a hot, viscous layer that makes up the majority of Earth's volume. The crust is the planet's
          outermost layer, which varies in thickness from about 5 kilometers beneath the oceans to 30 kilometers on
          land.

          The planet's surface, like that of Mars and Venus, features mountains, volcanoes, and valleys. Earth’s
          tectonic plates are constantly shifting, leading to earthquakes and the formation of mountain ranges. Around
          70% of Earth's surface is covered by oceans, which contain nearly all of the planet's water and hide many
          volcanoes beneath their depths.

          Earth's atmosphere consists primarily of nitrogen (78%) and oxygen (21%), with trace amounts of other gases
          such as carbon dioxide. This atmosphere not only shields Earth from harmful solar radiation but also protects
          it from meteoroids. The planet's magnetic field, generated by its molten core, creates the aurorae near the
          poles as charged particles from the Sun interact with the atmosphere. This magnetic field also governs compass
          directions, with the Earth's magnetic poles flipping roughly every 400,000 years, though this does not appear
          to affect life on Earth.

          In conclusion, Earth's combination of water, atmosphere, and magnetic field make it a rare and unique planet,
          supporting a diversity of life that continues to evolve amidst the challenges posed by climate change.

  <!-- Mars -->
  <main id="planets-container">
    <section class="planet-card">
      <div class="planet-model" id="mars-model"></div>
      <div class="planet-info card-black">
        <h2>Mars</h2>
        <p class="planet-text short">
          Mars, the fourth planet from the Sun, named The Mysterious Red Planet, is a cold, dusty desert world with a
          very thin atmosphere. Despite its barren appearance, Mars is a dynamic planet marked by seasons, weather
          patterns, polar ice caps, extinct volcanoes, and vast canyons. Its rusty red color, caused by oxidized iron
          minerals in the soil, has earned it the nickname “The Red Planet.” Ancient civilizations were fascinated by
          Mars — the Romans named it after their god of war, while the Egyptians called it “Her Desher,” meaning “the
          red one.”

          Mars is one of the most studied celestial bodies in our solar system. It’s the only planet beyond Earth where
          rovers have explored the surface, revealing a past where water once flowed freely and the atmosphere was
          thicker and more Earth-like billions of years ago. Though scientists don't expect to find life there today,
          they continue to search for evidence of ancient microbial life.

          In size, Mars is about half the diameter of Earth, with a radius of 3,390 kilometers (2,106 miles). If Earth
          were a nickel, Mars would be the size of a raspberry. It orbits the Sun at an average distance of 228 million
          kilometers (142 million miles), taking about 687 Earth days — or 669.6 Martian sols — to complete a year. A
          Martian day, or "sol," lasts 24.6 hours, slightly longer than an Earth day.

          Mars experiences seasons due to its axial tilt of 25 degrees, similar to Earth's 23.4 degrees. However,
          because of its elliptical orbit, its seasons are uneven in duration. Northern spring (southern autumn) is the
          longest season at 194 sols, while northern autumn (southern spring) is the shortest at 142 sols.

          Orbiting Mars are two small moons — Phobos and Deimos — thought to be captured asteroids. Irregularly shaped
          due to their low mass, these moons were named after the horses of the Greek god Ares. Phobos, the larger moon,
          is slowly spiraling toward Mars and is expected to crash into the planet or break apart in about 50 million
          years, possibly forming a temporary ring. Deimos, which is smaller and orbits farther away, has a smoother
          surface due to loose dust filling its craters.

          Mars lacks a global magnetic field today, though regions of the crust retain magnetism, suggesting the planet
          once had one billions of years ago. It also lacks planetary rings — at least for now. If Phobos breaks apart,
          it could form a ring of debris around the planet.

          Structurally, Mars is composed of a dense iron-nickel-sulfur core, a rocky mantle, and a crust rich in
          elements like iron, magnesium, aluminum, and calcium. Its surface features an impressive variety of colors —
          browns, tans, and reds — shaped over eons by volcanic activity, meteor impacts, tectonic shifts, and massive
          dust storms.

          Among Mars' most iconic features is Olympus Mons, the largest volcano in the solar system, standing three
          times taller than Mount Everest. Nearby, Valles Marineris — a canyon system over 4,800 kilometers (3,000
          miles) long — dwarfs Earth’s Grand Canyon in scale and depth. Evidence of ancient rivers, lakebeds, and flood
          channels reveals that Mars once had flowing water, though today water exists mostly as ice in polar regions or
          as salty brines that seasonally seep down crater walls.

          The Martian atmosphere is thin and primarily composed of carbon dioxide, with nitrogen and argon present in
          smaller amounts. This sparse atmosphere offers little protection from space debris or temperature extremes,
          which can range from 20°C (70°F) to -153°C (-225°F). During the day, temperatures can vary greatly from the
          ground to head height due to rapid heat loss.

          Dust storms, sometimes global in scale, can envelop the planet and take months to clear. The sky, tinted by
          fine particles in the air, appears more hazy red than the familiar blue skies of Earth.

          Despite its harsh conditions, Mars remains a prime target in the search for ancient life and future human
          exploration. With each new mission, we uncover more of its secrets and get closer to understanding our
          neighboring world.

  <!-- Jupiter -->

      <div class="planet-info card-black">
        <h2>Jupiter</h2>
        <p class="planet-text short">
          Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system, named too 'The Giant of Extremes', is a world of astonishing
          contrasts and dynamic phenomena. With a radius of 69,911 kilometers (43,440.7 miles), it’s about 11 times
          wider than Earth—if hollow, it could contain over 1,000 Earths. Despite its massive size, Jupiter has the
          shortest day of all planets, completing a rotation every 9.9 hours. It formed roughly 4.6 billion years ago
          from the residual gas and dust left behind after the Sun's birth, making it the oldest planet in the solar
          system.

          Jupiter’s swirling atmosphere, composed primarily of hydrogen and helium, is adorned with bands of clouds in
          alternating colors and directions. The darker bands, called belts, and the lighter ones, known as zones, are
          powerful jet streams blowing in opposite directions. Among these dynamic patterns lies the Great Red Spot, a
          colossal storm larger than Earth that has persisted for centuries. These atmospheric features are just the
          surface of a planet with no true solid ground—what lies beneath is a vast, violent ocean of liquid hydrogen
          and extreme pressure.

          Named after the king of the Roman gods, Jupiter dominates not only in size but also in its complex system of
          95 known moons. Its four largest—Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto—were first spotted by Galileo Galilei in
          1610 and are known as the Galilean moons. Each of these satellites is unique: Io is riddled with active
          volcanoes, Ganymede is the largest moon in the solar system, Callisto hints at geologic activity, and Europa
          may host a subsurface ocean with the potential for life.

          Despite its inhospitable atmosphere, which features extreme temperatures and crushing pressure, Jupiter is
          central to our understanding of planetary formation. Data from NASA’s Juno mission revealed a fuzzy, partially
          dissolved core much larger than expected, lacking a distinct boundary from the surrounding metallic hydrogen.
          The deep atmosphere is composed of three cloud layers—ammonia ice, ammonium hydrosulfide, and water
          ice—stretching across 71 kilometers (44 miles). Winds can reach 539 km/h (335 mph), and storms such as the
          Great Red Spot can plunge 500 kilometers (300 miles) beneath the cloud tops.

          Juno also uncovered long-lasting cyclones at both poles arranged in unique geometric patterns—eight in an
          octagon in the north and five in a pentagon in the south. These massive cyclones are held in place by central
          polar vortices, preventing them from drifting poleward. Jupiter’s belts and zones extend as deep as 3,200
          kilometers (2,000 miles), revealing layered convection patterns that mirror the movements of Earth’s oceans.

          Another surprising discovery: Jupiter has a ring system, faint and dusty, first detected in 1979 by Voyager 1.
          These rings are made of particles likely ejected by impacts on the planet’s small inner moons.

          The planet's magnetosphere is unmatched in strength, stretching up to 3 million kilometers (2 million miles)
          toward the Sun and trailing 1 billion kilometers (600 million miles) behind it—reaching beyond Saturn's orbit.
          This magnetic force field traps charged particles and creates intense radiation, posing serious challenges for
          spacecraft. It also powers breathtaking auroras at Jupiter's poles, some of the brightest and most energetic
          in the solar system.

          Although Jupiter itself is unlikely to support life, its moons—particularly Europa—offer promising
          environments for future exploration. Beneath Europa’s icy shell may lie a vast ocean capable of supporting
          microbial life, making Jupiter not just a planetary marvel, but a cornerstone in the search for life beyond
          Earth.

        <h2>Saturn</h2>
        <p class="planet-text short">
          Saturn, the sixth planet from the Sun, named too 'The Ringed Giant of the Solar System', is the second-largest
          planet in our solar system and a spectacular
          example of the beauty and mystery of the cosmos. Much like its fellow gas giant, Jupiter, Saturn is composed
          primarily of hydrogen and helium, forming a massive, swirling sphere without a solid surface.

          What truly sets Saturn apart is its extraordinary ring system—the most extensive and visually stunning of any
          planet. These rings, made up of billions of ice and rock particles, range in size from grains of dust to
          house-sized chunks, and even some as large as mountains. They orbit Saturn at varying speeds and stretch out
          up to 175,000 miles (282,000 kilometers) from the planet’s surface, though they are only about 30 feet (10
          meters) thick in most areas. Among them lies the prominent Cassini Division, a 2,920-mile-wide (4,700
          kilometers) gap separating Rings A and B.

          Saturn’s allure extends beyond its rings to its diverse and intriguing collection of moons. As of June 8,
          2023, Saturn boasts 146 confirmed moons, with more awaiting official recognition. These moons include Titan,
          shrouded in thick, smoggy clouds and home to methane lakes, and Enceladus, which sprays jets of water from its
          subsurface ocean—both considered among the most promising places in the solar system to harbor life.

          Despite the potential on its moons, Saturn itself is an inhospitable world. Its environment is extreme, with
          high pressures, low temperatures, and violent storms that would make life as we know it impossible.
          Nevertheless, the possibility of life in the oceans beneath the icy crusts of moons like Titan and Enceladus
          keeps scientists intrigued.

          Saturn is a colossal planet, approximately 9 times wider than Earth with a diameter of 74,897 miles (120,500
          kilometers). If Earth were the size of a nickel, Saturn would be about the size of a volleyball. It sits an
          average of 886 million miles (1.4 billion kilometers) from the Sun—about 9.5 times the Earth-Sun
          distance—meaning sunlight takes around 80 minutes to reach it.

          The planet spins rapidly, completing a full rotation in just 10.7 hours, making its day one of the shortest in
          the solar system. Its year, however, is long, lasting about 29.4 Earth years. Like Earth, Saturn experiences
          seasons due to its axial tilt of 26.73 degrees.

          Beneath Saturn’s upper layers lies a dense core of metal and rock, surrounded by metallic hydrogen and a vast
          layer of liquid hydrogen. Despite its immense mass, Saturn’s average density is so low that it would float in
          water, hypothetically.

          Its atmosphere is dynamic, characterized by fast winds, jet streams, and massive storms. Winds near the
          equator can reach speeds of 1,600 feet per second (500 meters per second)—significantly faster than Earth’s
          most powerful hurricanes. A unique hexagonal storm system, first spotted by the Voyager spacecraft and studied
          in detail by Cassini, crowns Saturn’s north pole. This six-sided jet stream spans roughly 20,000 miles (30,000
          kilometers) and surrounds a powerful cyclone.

          Saturn’s magnetosphere, while smaller than Jupiter’s, is still 578 times stronger than Earth’s. It encloses
          the planet, its rings, and most of its moons, influencing electrically charged particles in space. The planet
          also displays brilliant aurorae, some of which, unlike Earth’s, are caused not by solar wind but by particles
          from its own moons and rapid magnetic rotation—phenomena still not fully understood.

          Known since ancient times, Saturn is named after the Roman god of agriculture and wealth, and as the most
          distant planet visible to the naked eye, it has inspired wonder for millennia. With its majestic rings,
          mysterious moons, and dynamic atmosphere, Saturn remains one of the most captivating objects in our solar
          system.

        <h2>Uranus</h2>
        <p class="planet-text short">
        <p>Uranus, the seventh planet from the Sun, named too 'The Tilted Ice Giant of the Solar System' is an icy,
          distant world that holds a special place in the solar
          system for its unique rotation and cold, mysterious atmosphere. Often referred to as an "ice giant" alongside
          Neptune, Uranus is composed primarily of water, ammonia, and methane ices, layered around a rocky core and
          surrounded by an atmosphere of hydrogen and helium.</p>

        <p>What truly sets Uranus apart is its extreme axial tilt of about 98 degrees, causing it to rotate on its side.
          This makes it the only planet in the solar system to have such a dramatic orientation, resulting in bizarre
          and extreme seasons—each lasting over 20 Earth years. For nearly a quarter of its 84-year orbit, one pole is
          bathed in constant sunlight while the other is plunged into complete darkness.</p>

        <p>Discovered in 1781 by astronomer William Herschel, Uranus was the first planet found with a telescope.
          Initially mistaken for a star or comet, its planetary nature was later confirmed by astronomers like Johann
          Bode, who also proposed its mythological name. Departing from Roman mythology, Uranus was named after the
          ancient Greek god of the sky, the father of Saturn.</p>

        <p>Uranus is a pale blue-green planet, a color caused by methane in its upper atmosphere which absorbs red light
          and reflects blue. Despite its relatively featureless appearance through most telescopes, Uranus is a dynamic
          planet with powerful winds reaching speeds of up to 560 miles per hour (900 kilometers per hour) and a
          complex, layered atmosphere. Surprisingly, it is also one of the coldest places in the solar system, with
          temperatures plunging to -371°F (-224°C).</p>

        <p>Orbiting Uranus is a collection of 28 known moons, many named after characters from the works of William
          Shakespeare and Alexander Pope—such as Titania, Oberon, and Miranda. These moons vary widely in size and
          composition, with several showing signs of geological activity and intriguing surface features. Uranus also
          has 13 known rings, far fainter and narrower than Saturn’s but still fascinating. The inner rings are dark and
          thin, while two outer rings are more colorful, with one appearing reddish and the other bright blue.</p>

        <p>Uranus is enormous—four times wider than Earth—with a diameter of about 31,763 miles (51,118 kilometers).
          Despite its size, it’s the second least dense planet in the solar system after Saturn. If Earth were the size
          of a nickel, Uranus would be roughly the size of a softball. It sits about 1.8 billion miles (2.9 billion
          kilometers) from the Sun, or 19 times farther than Earth, meaning sunlight takes around 2 hours and 40 minutes
          to reach it.</p>

        <p>A day on Uranus lasts approximately 17 hours, but its long journey around the Sun takes 84 Earth years to
          complete. Like Venus, Uranus rotates in the opposite direction of most other planets—a retrograde rotation
          likely caused by a massive collision early in its history, which also explains its extreme tilt.</p>

        <p>Beneath its hazy atmosphere lies a slushy, dense mix of icy materials and a rocky core. Temperatures at the
          core may reach as high as 9,000°F (5,000°C), despite the frigid outer layers. Uranus’ interior doesn't radiate
          much heat, which further contributes to its status as the coldest planet in the solar system.</p>

        <p>The planet’s magnetic field is just as unusual as its rotation. It is tilted about 60 degrees from the axis
          and is offset from the planet’s center, resulting in an irregular and twisted magnetosphere. This skewed
          magnetic field causes auroras on Uranus that differ significantly from those seen on Earth or Jupiter. Unlike
          other planets, these auroras are often not aligned with the magnetic poles, and scientists continue to study
          their mysterious behavior.</p>

        <p>Though the harsh conditions make Uranus inhospitable for life as we know it, the planet continues to
          captivate
          scientists and stargazers alike. Its curious tilt, icy atmosphere, elusive rings, and theatrical moons offer a
          glimpse into the diverse and dynamic nature of the outer solar system. As we look to future missions, Uranus
          remains one of the most intriguing destinations waiting to be explored in greater detail.</p>

  <!-- Neptune -->

        <h2>Neptune</h2>
        <p class="planet-text short">
          Neptune, the eighth and farthest known planet from the Sun, named to 'The Mysterious Ice Giant at the Edge of
          the Solar System' is a dynamic and mysterious world cloaked in deep
          blue hues and battered by the most extreme winds in the solar system. Classified as an ice giant, Neptune
          orbits more than 30 times farther from the Sun than Earth, making it a dark, frigid realm where sunlight is
          nearly 900 times dimmer than on our home planet.

          Discovered in 1846 through mathematical predictions rather than direct observation, Neptune was the first
          planet to be found in this way. Astronomers noticed irregularities in Uranus’ orbit and, using calculations by
          French mathematician Urbain Le Verrier, German astronomer Johann Galle located Neptune exactly where
          predicted. Just 17 days later, its largest moon, Triton, was discovered, hinting at a rich and complex
          planetary system.

          Neptune is massive—about four times wider than Earth, with an equatorial diameter of 30,775 miles (49,528
          kilometers). If Earth were the size of a nickel, Neptune would be a baseball. The planet is about 2.8 billion
          miles (4.5 billion kilometers) from the Sun, meaning sunlight takes roughly four hours to reach it.

          A single Neptunian day lasts just 16 hours, but a year drags on for 165 Earth years. Because of its 28-degree
          axial tilt, Neptune experiences seasons like Earth and Mars—but each lasts over 40 years due to its vast
          orbital path.

          Neptune’s atmosphere, composed mainly of hydrogen, helium, and methane, is strikingly dynamic. Methane gives
          the planet its blue color by absorbing red light and reflecting blue, although Voyager 2 images enhanced the
          contrast to reveal atmospheric features more clearly. Despite receiving very little solar energy, Neptune
          boasts the fastest winds in the solar system—reaching speeds over 1,200 miles per hour (2,000 kilometers per
          hour). These supersonic gales whip clouds of frozen methane across its skies, far outpacing even Jupiter’s
          fierce storms. In 1989, Voyager 2 observed a massive, Earth-sized storm known as the Great Dark Spot—though it
          has since vanished, new ones continue to appear.

          Neptune has no solid surface. Beneath its atmosphere lies a hot, dense mixture of water, ammonia, and methane
          ices above a rocky core roughly equal to Earth in mass. Some scientists believe a superheated ocean of water
          may exist deep inside, kept in a liquid state by immense pressure.

          The planet also possesses a powerful and oddly tilted magnetic field—27 times stronger than Earth’s and
          misaligned by 47 degrees with its axis of rotation. Like Uranus, this misalignment causes the magnetosphere to
          wobble wildly as the planet spins.

          Neptune’s largest moon, Triton, orbits in the opposite direction of Neptune’s rotation, suggesting it was
          likely a captured object. Despite surface temperatures plunging to -391°F (-235°C), Voyager 2 observed active
          geysers spewing icy material five miles (eight kilometers) high, making Triton one of the most geologically
          active moons in the outer solar system. Its thin, nitrogen-rich atmosphere appears to be warming, though the
          cause remains unknown.

          In total, Neptune has 16 known moons, all named after sea deities from Greek mythology in honor of the Roman
          god Neptune. Surrounding the planet is a system of at least five main rings—Galle, Leverrier, Lassell, Arago,
          and Adams—plus four distinctive clumps of dust known as arcs. These arcs—Liberté, Egalité, Fraternité, and
          Courage—persist mysteriously without dispersing, likely stabilized by the nearby moon Galatea.

          Formed about 4.5 billion years ago alongside the rest of the solar system, Neptune may have originated closer
          to the Sun before migrating outward to its current, frigid orbit. As the densest of the giant planets, Neptune
          continues to fascinate scientists with its dynamic storms, complex magnetic environment, and the potential
          secrets hidden beneath its icy clouds.

          Despite being invisible to the naked eye and residing in a remote corner of our cosmic neighborhood, Neptune
          remains a captivating symbol of the unknown—an icy enigma at the edge of the solar system, swirling with
          beauty, power, and mystery.
